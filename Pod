A pod is a collection of containers and its storage inside a node of a Kubernetes cluster.
It is possible to create a pod with multiple containers inside it.

There are two types of Pods :
Single container pod
Multi container pod

kubectl run <name of pod> --image=<name of the image from registry>   # to create a single container pod
kubectl run my_pod_tomcat --image = tomcat:8.0                        # pod create example

This can also be done by creating the yaml file and then running the kubectl create command :

tomcat.yml   :

apiVersion: v1                                #
kind: Pod                                     #
metadata:                                     #
   name: Tomcat                               #
spec:                                         #
   containers:                                #     POD CREATE YAML FILE (tomcat.yml)
   - name: Tomcat                             #
    image: tomcat: 8.0                        #
    ports:                                    #
containerPort: 7500                           #
   imagePullPolicy: Always                    #
   
kubectl create â€“f tomcat.yml                    # to create pod file

Multi container pods are created using yaml mail with the definition of the containers.

apiVersion: v1                                  #
kind: Pod                                       #
metadata:                                       #
   name: Tomcat                                 #
spec:                                           #
   containers:                                  #
   - name: Tomcat                               #
    image: tomcat: 8.0                          #       MULTI CONTAINER POD CREATE EXAMPLE
    ports:                                      #
containerPort: 7500                             #
   imagePullPolicy: Always                      #
   -name: Database                              #
   Image: mongoDB                               #
   Ports:                                       #
containerPort: 7501                             #
   imagePullPolicy: Always                      #




In the above code, we have created one pod with two containers inside it, one for tomcat and the other for MongoDB.
