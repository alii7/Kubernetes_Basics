A node is a working machine in Kubernetes cluster which is also known as a minion. 
They are working units which can be physical, VM, or a cloud instance.
Each node has all the required configuration required to run a pod on it such as the proxy service and kubelet service along with the Docker.

The key component of Kubernetes to handle multiple nodes is the controller manager.
To manage nodes, Kubernetes creates an object of kind node which will validate that the object which is created is a valid node.

apiVersion: v1                                  #
kind: node                                      #
metadata:                                       #         NODE SERVICE EXAMPLE
   name: < ip address of the node>              #
   labels:                                      #
      name: <lable name>                        #
