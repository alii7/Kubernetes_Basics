Secrets can be defined as Kubernetes objects used to store sensitive data such as user name and passwords with encryption.

Creating from txt files.
Creating from yaml file.

After storing secrets in a text file (file.txt) :
kubectl create secret generic tomcat-passwd –-from-file = ./username.txt –fromfile = ./. password.txt               # to store secrets in text file

apiVersion: v1                              #
kind: Secret                                #
metadata:                                   #
name: tomcat-pass                           #
type: Opaque                                #     CREATING SECRET YAML FILE EXAMPLE
data:                                       #
   password: <User Password>                #
   username: <User Name>                    #

kubectl create –f Secret.yaml                   # to create secret file

Using Secrets

Once we have created the secrets, it can be consumed in a pod or the replication controller as "Environment Variable" or "Volume".

In order to use the secret as environment variable, we will use env under the spec section of pod yaml file :

env:                                         #
- name: SECRET_USERNAME                      #
   valueFrom:                                #
      secretKeyRef:                          #     USING SECRETS AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
         name: mysecret                      #
         key: tomcat-pass                    #
         
    
spec:                                        #
   volumes:                                  #
      - name: "secretstest"                  #
         secret:                             #
            secretName: tomcat-pass          #
   containers:                               #      USING SECRETS AS VOLUME
      - image: tomcat:7.0                    #
         name: awebserver                    #
         volumeMounts:                       #
            - mountPath: "/tmp/mysec"        #
            name: "secretstest"              #

                  valueFrom:                             #
                     configMapKeyRef:                    #
                        name: appname                    #
                        key: tomcat-secrets              #



In the above code, under the env definition, we are using secrets as environment variable in the replication controller.

         volumeMounts:                       #
            - mountPath: "/tmp/mysec"        #
